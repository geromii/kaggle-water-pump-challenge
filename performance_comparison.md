# Water Pump Challenge Performance Comparison

## Original Notebook Performance
- Validation Accuracy: ~80.88% (best result)
- Model: RandomForestClassifier with StandardScaler
- Features: Basic feature selection with OrdinalEncoder

## Improved Model Performance
- **Random Forest: 81.77% (+/- 0.72%)**
- **XGBoost: 81.62% (+/- 0.72%)**  
- LightGBM: 80.76% (+/- 0.75%)

## Key Improvements Made

### 1. Enhanced Feature Engineering
- **Time-based features**: Recording year, month, day of year
- **Pump age calculation**: Age from construction to recording date
- **Geographic features**: Distance from origin, population density proxy
- **Interaction features**: 
  - quantity_quality (water quantity × quality)
  - extraction_management (extraction type × management)
  - payment_water_quality (payment × water quality)
- **Regional statistics**: Mean/std of amount_tsh, gps_height, population by region
- **Installer reliability**: Historical success rate of each installer

### 2. Better Missing Value Handling
- Created binary indicators for missing values
- Used median imputation instead of mean
- Handled zero values as missing for coordinates and construction year

### 3. Improved Model Selection
- Added XGBoost and LightGBM to the comparison
- Used proper cross-validation (5-fold stratified)
- Random Forest and XGBoost both outperformed the original

### 4. Top Important Features (from XGBoost)
1. quantity (14.3%)
2. waterpoint_type_group (7.2%)
3. installer_reliability (5.4%)
4. longitude_is_missing (5.2%)
5. waterpoint_type (4.8%)

## Conclusion
The improved model achieved **~1% better accuracy** through:
- More sophisticated feature engineering
- Better handling of missing values
- Cross-validation for robust evaluation
- Testing multiple algorithms

The installer reliability feature and missing value indicators proved particularly valuable.
